### Multi-Factor Authentication Report

This report lists all the users in the tenant and the status of the user in regards to Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). For instance, it reports on whether they're enabled via Per-User MFA or enabled via Conditional Access or, whether it's enforced via Security Defaults.

Users with no MFA method configured show with a red highlight.
